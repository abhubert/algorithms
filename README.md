# algorithms

This is a collections of my implementations of common algorithms and datastructures and datastructures in Java.

## Motivation

Throughtout my education and work I've come across algorithms both simple and complex. Trying my own hand at implementing them helps me get a feel for the algorithm. This project is new and I am currently working on putting together algorithms I have coded while adding new ones.

## Built Using

OpenJDK 15
Maven
VS Code
