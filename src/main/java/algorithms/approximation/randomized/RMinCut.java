/**
* Solves min-cut using Krager's Algorithm
*
* The program first reads the graph from args constructing
* a list of edges and verticies using ArrayList storing
* the nodes as strings using a graph class to keep track.
* I leave out self loops since they will never be in the cut.
*
* Since ArrayList has order the edges must be checked
* for both source and destination in some cases.
*
* The program then implements Krager's Algorithm by randomly
* generating an index and picking the edge at that index. 
* it then concatonates the strings to make the new node and 
* updates the edges and removes self loops before chosing the
* next random number until 2 verticies are left.
*
* The number of runs was calculated by solving 
* (1-2/n^2)^runtimes = 0.01 because we want the probability
* of every run to give the wrong answer to be 0.01.
